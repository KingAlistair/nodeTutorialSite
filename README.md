## What the project does
NodeTutorialSite is a tutorial site designed to help users learn the basics of Node.js. The project was created as a part of the Node.js Mandatory I course, with the purpose of allowing me to practice and learn Node.js while creating a useful tool for others.

The site covers a range of topics, including what Node.js is, how to create and run a server, how to handle HTML pages with Express, and how to create endpoints to fetch data from the backend. The site is designed for users with little to no experience with Node.js, and the step-by-step instructions and code examples make it easy to follow along.

## Why the project is useful
Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building scalable, high-performance applications. However, for those new to Node.js, it can be challenging to get started. The NodeTutorialSite project provides a comprehensive introduction to Node.js and helps users get up and running with the technology quickly and easily.

## How users can get started with the project
To get started with NodeTutorialSite, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once Node.js is installed, you can clone the repository and run the application using the command npm start. The application will be hosted on localhost:8080.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
NodeTutorialSite is currently maintained by [me](https://github.com/KingAlistair), who created the project as a part of the Node.js Mandatory I course. As an open-source project, contributions are welcome from the community.
