    <h1>2. REST API</h1><br>
    <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web-based application
        programming interface (API) that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
        etc. to interact with resources (data) on a web server. REST is a design architecture
        for building networked applications.</p><br>

    <h2><b>Endpoint naming standards</b></h2>
    <p>It is important to choose meaningful and consistent naming standards for endpoints to make them easily
        understandable and maintainable. There are various naming standards for endpoints, but some common practices
        include:</p>

    <p><b>1. Use plural nouns to represent resources:</b> Endpoints should represent a resource, and the name of the
        endpoint
        should be a plural noun that describes the resource. For example, /songs to represent a collection of songs.
    </p>
    <p><b>2. Use lowercase and hyphens for readability:</b> Endpoint names should be in all lowercase, and hyphens
        can be
        used to separate words for better readability. For example, /best-selling-songs instead of /bestSellingSongs
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Use HTTP methods for different actions:</b> Different HTTP methods should be used for different actions
        on a resource. For example, GET /songs to retrieve a list of songs, POST /songs to create a new song,
        PUT /songs/:id to update a song, and DELETE /songs/:id to delete a song.
    </p>
    <p><b>4. Use nouns for resources and verbs for actions:</b> Endpoint names should be descriptive and represent
        the resource and action being performed. For example, /albums/:id/songs to represent the songs of an album,
        and
        /albums/:id/songs/:song_id to represent a specific song of an album.

    <h2><b>Fetch examples</b></h3>

        <p><b>Copy the next code exapmle to your app.js file</b></p>
        <p>Here you can see 5 API endpoints, that we can use to manipulate json objects. At the bottom of
            the code, there is an array of song objects that will serve as our database for now.</p>
        <p>You can try the GET methods in your browser while your server is running by calling the endpoints
            (http://localhost:8080/songs)
            or you can download <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> to try them all.</p>
