        <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
        <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google. It allows developers to use JavaScript to build fast, scalable, and efficient web applications that can handle large amounts of data in real-time. Node.js has become incredibly popular in recent years due to its ability to handle a high volume of simultaneous connections with low overhead.</p>
        <p>One of the most significant advantages of Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle many requests without blocking other tasks. This makes it particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time communication and data-intensive tasks, such as chat applications, video streaming, and online gaming.</p>
        <p>Node.js has a large and active community, with a vast library of modules available through the Node Package Manager (NPM) that can be easily integrated into your application. Additionally, Node.js is highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom modules and add-ons for specific use cases.</p>
        <p>Overall, Node.js is a powerful and versatile tool that offers developers the flexibility to build fast and efficient web applications using the same language on both the client and server-side.</p>
