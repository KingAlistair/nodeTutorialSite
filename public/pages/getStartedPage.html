        <h3>1. A development environment</h3>
        <p> A development environment is a workspace that enables developers to build an application or make changes to
            it without affecting the live version of the software product. These changes can include maintenance,
            debugging, and patching. Two popular options you can choose from is Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.

        <h3>2. Node.js</h3>
        <p>Downloading Node.js gives you access to a powerful and versatile platform that can help you build robust and
            scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. With it you will be able to;</p>
        <p><b>1. Run server-side applications:</b> Node.js is commonly used to develop server-side applications, such as
            web servers, APIs, and real-time applications, making it easier for developers to build scalable and
            high-performance applications.</p>
        <p><b>2. Access to a vast collection of packages: </b> Node.js has a massive package ecosystem, known as npm
            (Node Package Manager), which contains over 1 million packages, libraries, and tools that developers can use
            to build their applications.</p>
        <p><b>3. Use of JavaScript on the server:</b>With Node.js, developers can write server-side code using
            JavaScript, a language that they are already familiar with, instead of learning a new language or
            technology.</p>
