    <p>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Node.js involves rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This is in contrast to client-side rendering, where the page is rendered in the user's browser using JavaScript.</p>
    <p>With SSR, the server sends a fully-formed HTML page to the client, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed. SSR can also improve search engine optimization (SEO) by making it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content of a website.</p>
    <p>In Node.js, there are several libraries and frameworks available for implementing SSR, including Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Express.js. These tools provide developers with features such as automatic code splitting, server-side caching, and support for serverless environments.</p>
    <p>Overall, SSR in Node.js can be a powerful technique for building fast, SEO-friendly web applications.</p>
