    <h2>What is Express?</h2><br>
    <p>Express is a popular, open-source web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and
        tools that simplify the development of web applications in Node.js. Express is designed to be lightweight,
        flexible, and modular, which makes it suitable for building small to large-scale web applications.</p>
    <p>Express provides many features that make web application development easier, such as routing, middleware, and
        template engine support. Routing allows developers to define how the application responds to client requests
        for specific URLs, while middleware functions can be used to handle authentication, logging, and other
        common tasks. Express also supports a wide variety of template engines, including Pug, EJS, and Handlebars,
        which makes it easy to render dynamic HTML pages with minimal code.</p>
    <p>Express is highly extensible and customizable, allowing developers to add third-party plugins and middleware
        to enhance its functionality. Additionally, it has a large and active community that provides many
        resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and example code.</p>
    <p>Overall, Express is a powerful and flexible web application framework that simplifies the development of
        Node.js-based web applications, making it a popular choice among developers.</p><br>

    <h2>Let's create your first project!</h2><br>

    <p><b>1. Create a folder for your project in your chosen IDE. Let's call it myNodeSite</b></p>
    <p><b>2. In your terminal change your directory to that folder: cd myNodeSite</b></p>
    <p><b>3. Install express: npm install express</b></p>
    <p>Installing express creates a package.json file to handle dependencies, meta data, and scripts</p>
    <p><b>4. Create a file called app.js</b></p>
    <p><b>5. Write the following code in app.js</b></p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">import express from "express";
        const app = express();
        
        const PORT = 8080;
        app.listen(PORT, (error) => {
            if (error) {
                console.log(error);
                return;
            }
            console.log("Server is running on port: " + PORT);
        });
</code></pre>

    <p><b>6. Run command: node app.js</b></p>
    <p><b>7. Try it here to see the output!</b></p>
    <input id="runNodeInput" placeholder="node app.js"></input><button onclick="startNode()">Enter</button>
