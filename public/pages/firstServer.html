        <h2>What is Express?</h2>
        <p>Express is a popular, open-source web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools that simplify the development of web applications in Node.js. Express is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and modular, which makes it suitable for building small to large-scale web applications.</p>
        <p>Express provides many features that make web application development easier, such as routing, middleware, and template engine support. Routing allows developers to define how the application responds to client requests for specific URLs, while middleware functions can be used to handle authentication, logging, and other common tasks. Express also supports a wide variety of template engines, including Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, which makes it easy to render dynamic HTML pages with minimal code.</p>
        <p>Express is highly extensible and customizable, allowing developers to add third-party plugins and middleware to enhance its functionality. Additionally, it has a large and active community that provides many resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and example code.</p>
        <p>Overall, Express is a powerful and flexible web application framework that simplifies the development of Node.js-based web applications, making it a popular choice among developers.</p>
